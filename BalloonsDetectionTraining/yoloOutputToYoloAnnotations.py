"""
This script is designed to remap detection outputs from YOLO text format to the YOLO training format. It processes a given folder containing image files and their corresponding detection annotation files. For each image and its associated detection file, the script reads the detections, converts their bounding box coordinates from absolute pixel values to normalized values relative to the image dimensions, and then writes these normalized values to a new output file in YOLO format.

Before running the script, ensure the 'folder_path' variable is set to the directory containing your images and detection files. The detection files should be in the format '<image_name>.txt', with each line representing a detected object in the format 'class_name confidence x_start y_start x_end y_end'.

Run this script from the root of the project.
